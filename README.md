## Hi there, Iâ€™m Will ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m the Head of Development at [AMIVA+](https://www.amivaplus.com) ðŸš€, where I lead a small team of engineers specializing in React, Django, and Google Cloud Platform. My team is dedicated to building scalable, innovative M&A solutions, and Iâ€™m always excited to tackle new challenges in building better tools for streamlining historically convoluted business processes.

ðŸ”§ Tech Stack:

	â€¢	Frontend: React, TypeScript
	â€¢	Backend: Django, REST APIs, Python
	â€¢	Cloud: Google Cloud Platform (GCP), Docker, Kubernetes

Iâ€™ve been working professionally as a full-stack developer since Fall 2022, and before that, I graduated from NYU with a degree in Film and a minor in Math ðŸŽ¥âž•ðŸ“Š, with honors.

The 'c' key on my keyboard broke this morning so every time you see the letter 'c' here, it's been pasted from my clipboard. ðŸ˜Ž
